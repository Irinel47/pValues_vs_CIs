# Why Confidence Intervals Matter More Than P-Values: A Retail Sales Use Case

## Overview
Statistical analysis plays a crucial role in helping businesses make informed decisions.
A common method for determining whether a change has a significant impact is the use of **p-values**.
While p-values tell us whether a result is statistically significant, they fall short in providing the full picture. 
This is where **confidence intervals (CIs)** come into play — they provide not just statistical significance but also insight into the range and reliability of results.
In this project, we explore why confidence intervals are more informative than p-values through a real-world retail sales use case. We'll analyze the **average order value (AOV)** before and after a promotional campaign using the **UCI Online Retail Dataset**.

## Key Topics
- Statistical Significance vs. Practical Significance
- Limitations of p-values
- Benefits of Confidence Intervals
- Real-world application in retail sales

## Use Case
The project demonstrates:
- A comparison of the **average order value (AOV)** before and after a promotional campaign.
- Insights derived from confidence intervals that enhance business decision-making.

## Dataset
We use the **UCI Online Retail Dataset**, which contains transactional data for a UK-based online retail store.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- SciPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
